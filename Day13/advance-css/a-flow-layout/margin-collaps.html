        Margin sometimes collapses when they put beside each other. The rules are:
        1. Only vertical margins collapse.
        2. The largest margin wins.
        3. Margins only collapse in flow layout.
        4. Margins don't collapse if they didn't touch each other directly.
        5. Nesting doesn't prevent margin collapse.
        6. Margins can collapse in the same direction.
        7. More than two margins can collapse.
